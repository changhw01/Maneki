Marketing Compaign Management and Reward Delivery System


Introduction
======

Marc Andreessen said that Bitcoin is a four-sided network effect consists of user, merchant, miner, and developers. Each side has a positive feedback loop (i.e., more population of each role will accelerate its growth). As we think more about current state of Bitcoin, about 450K user owns USD 100+ worth of Bitcoins. The ecosystem is still in its infancy. We would like to experiment a economical system that provides "incentives" among the four roles. For example, one merchant may be interested in certain types of user; certain group of user is seeking for specific merchant. Adding the ingredient of "incentives" may motivate more users and merchants to be part of this ecosystem.

There are a couple ways to understand a user's needs and where the customers are for merchants. A preliminary solution is to take advantage of smartphone sensors and algorithms that are able to categorize user's behavioral pattern. It is merchant's job to define their target customers, however, this system can help merchants find users who fit into certain behavioral pattern. Now, we sort of connect the user and merchant by providing a matching mechanism. It occurs to us that users can also be miners who generate some share of cryptocurrency by doing proof-of-work. When a user perform certain behavior, like a miner, s/he can be rewarded for doing that behavior. This rewarding process notifies the merchant who is interested this type of behavior, so that the merchant is incentified to find their potential customers and pay the reward fee.
