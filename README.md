Incentive Management (for merchant marketing compaigns), Reward Delivery System, and Distributed Biobehavioral Wallet for Cryptocurrencies


Introduction
======

We illustrate a conceptual framework to add "incentives" to Bitcoin's four-sided network effect. Marc Andreessen noted that Bitcoin is a four-sided network effect consists of user, merchant, miner, and developers. Each side has a positive feedback loop (i.e., more population of each role will accelerate its growth). As we think more about current state of Bitcoin, about 450K user owns USD 100+ worth of Bitcoins. This ecosystem is still in its infancy. We would like to experiment a economic system that provides "incentives" among the four roles to grow the ecosystem. For example, one merchant may be interested in certain types of user; certain group of user is seeking for specific merchant. Adding the ingredient of "incentives" may motivate more users and merchants to be part of this ecosystem.

There are a couple ways to understand a user's needs and where the customers are for merchants. A preliminary solution is to take advantage of smartphone sensors and algorithms that are able to categorize user's behavioral pattern. It is merchant's job to define their target customers, however, this system can help merchants find users who fit into certain behavioral pattern. Now, we sort of connect the user and merchant by providing a matching mechanism. It occurs to us that users can also be miners who generate some share of cryptocurrency by doing proof-of-work. When a user perform certain behavior, like a miner, s/he can be rewarded for doing that behavior. This rewarding process notifies the merchant who is interested this type of behavior, so that the merchant is incentified to find their potential customers and pay the reward fee. Developes, who help find and define users' behavorial patterns, could also be awarded from this system.


Distributed Biobehavioral Crypto Wallet
======

Apple pulled the last crypto wallet app from the Appstore means that crypto wallet could only exist as web wallet on iOS devices. This implies Android will become the major platform for crypto wallets in the near future. However, there is a potential solution to this. There is a [startup](http://www.bionym.com/) working on using ECG features with crypto wallet. This approach uses biometric identification as a way to validate wallet owner's control. This approach could be further extended with a concept of distributed wearable wallets signed by owner's biobehavioral indentification.

Distributed biobehavioral nodes are doing Proof-of-Work by collecting biosensing and behavioral data from the owner. Like Bitcoin's blockchain, these nodes store bio data just like Bitcoin's irreversible public ledger, but stored privately/distributedly on the wearable nodes.
